Implement the type Addition that is ` + ` in Javascript by using BuildTuple.

0 <= addend <= 999, limited by Typescript v4.6.2

It's a simple version of [ 476-Sum ](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/master/questions/476-extreme-sum/README.md).

For example

```ts
Addition<10, 10> // expect to be 20
```
