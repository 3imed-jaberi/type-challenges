Implement the type Multiplication that is ` * ` in Javascript by using BuildTuple.

0 <= multiplier <= 999, 0 <= product <= 9999, limited by Typescript v4.6.2.

If the length of a tuple is greater than 9999, it will show 'Type produces a tuple type that is too large to represent. ts(2799)'... ðŸ¤”

It's a simple version of [ 517 - Multiply ](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/master/questions/517-extreme-multiply/README.md).

For example

```ts
Multiplication<2, 5> // expect to be 10
```
